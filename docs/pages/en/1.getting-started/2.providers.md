description: Nuxt Image supports multiple providers for high performances.

Providers are integrations between Nuxt Image and third-party image transformation services. Each provider is responsible for generating correct URLs for that image transformation service.

Nuxt Image can be configured to work with any external image transformation service. Here is a list of providers that are supported out-of-the-box and can be easily configured to use:

- [`IPX`](/providers/ipx) (default)
- [`Cloudinary`](/providers/cloudinary)
- [`Fastly`](/providers/fastly)
- [`Imgix`](/providers/imgix)
- [`Prismic`](/providers/prismic)
- [`Sanity`](/providers/sanity)
- [`Twicpics`](/providers/twicpics)
- [`Storyblok`](/providers/storyblok)

If you are looking for a specific provider outside of this list, you can [create your own provider](/advanced/custom-provider).

Nuxt Image will automatically optimize `<nuxt-img>` or `<nuxt-picture>` sources and accepts all [options](/api/options/) for specified target, except for modifiers that are specific to other providers.

## Default Provider

The default provider for Nuxt Image is [ipx provider](/providers/ipx) or [static images](/getting-started/static) (for `target: static`). Either option can be used without any configuration.

[IPX](https://github.com/nuxt-contrib/ipx) is an opensource and self-hosted image optimizer based on [Sharp](https://github.com/lovell/sharp) developed by the Nuxt team.

The image module internally uses IPX for static image optimization but you can also self-host it as a runtime optimizer by enabling provider.

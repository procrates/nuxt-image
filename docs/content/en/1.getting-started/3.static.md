If you are building a static site, Nuxt Image will optimize and save your images locally when your site is generated - and deploy them alongside your generated pages.

Even if you are using another provider, you can opt-in to this generate behaviour for a particular image by setting `provider="static"` directly. (See [component documentation](/components/nuxt-img) for more information.)

`<nuxt-picture>` is a drop-in replacement for the native `<picture>` tag.

Usage of `<nuxt-picture>` is almost identical to [`<nuxt-img>`](./nuxt-img)
but also allows serving modern formats like `webp` when possible and at the moment only supports native lazy loading.

### legacyFormat

Format used for fallback. Default is conditional:

- If original format supports transparently (`png`, `webp` and `gif`), `png` is used for fallback
- Otherwise `jpeg` is used for fallback
